<h2>Getting Started</h2>
# MS-Playwright-Cucumber-BDD-HTML: This Project is demo of Microsoft Playwright Test framework with Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) with cucumber HTML reporter <br><br>

What is Playwright?<br>
Built by Microsoft, Playwright is a Node.js library that, with a single API, automates Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. These APIs can be used by developers writing JavaScript code to create new browser pages, navigate to URLs and then interact with elements on a page. In addition, since Microsoft Edge is built on the open-source Chromium web platform, Playwright can also automate Microsoft Edge.


<br>
What is BDD?<br>
Behavior-driven development (BDD) is an Agile software development methodology in which an application is documented and designed around the behavior a user expects to experience when interacting with it. By encouraging developers to focus only on the requested behaviors of an app or program, BDD helps to avoid bloat, excessive code, unnecessary features or lack of focus. This methodology combines, augments and refines the practices used in test-driven development (TDD) and acceptance testing.
